										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>By Q2 2023, I completed 12 weeks of training at Digital Futures to kickstart my career in data science, quickly becoming proficient in Python, SQL and Tableau which allowed me conquer descriptive analytics and machine learning projects. This led to me being recognised as a Certified Associate in Python Programming (PCAP) by the Python Institute in May 2023, passing my PCAP exam with a score of 98%.</p>
									<p>What attracts me to data science is the ability to navigate large datasets with technologies, in order to answer questions that haven't been asked yet and therefore mitigate against future problems. This allows businesses and other organisations to be much more proactive and ahead of the curve. I also like that there is room for creativity in this field, due to the numerous ways data can be collected, cleaned, modelled and predicted. I'm particularly interested in reducing bias such that any solutions I create benefit as many people as possible.</p>
									<p>I bring with me four years of marketing and communications experience such as improving email open rates at Poplar Studio by 16% year-on-year with a self-devised content strategy that I optimised monthly based on performance data analysis, and driving an average of 70%-sold in ticket sales for October Gallery events.</p>
									<p>The commercial awareness gained from this experience will allow me to prioritise user and business outcomes during data science projects ensure that they produce relevant, valuable solutions. Furthermore, my ability to adapt to numerous sectors has made it easier for me to liaise with several stakeholders across different levels and understand the specific challenges they each face.</p>
									<p>I'm open to opportunities so please do not hesitate to get in touch via LinkedIn or email if you think I'd make a valuable addition to your team!</p>
