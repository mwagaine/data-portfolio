										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I'm Matthew - a Lead Data Engineer specialising in on-prem (Hadoop) and cloud-based (GCP) pipeline development, harnessing tools such as Scala, PySpark, Airflow and the CI/CD Jenkins platform within automated workflows. I am also versatile in my programming approaches (object-oriented, functional, modular) to prioritise strategic, efficient and robust solutions.</p>
									<p>With sharp communication and project management, I orchestrate multiple pipeline deliveries simultaneously. From extracting real meaning about requirements and input data from analysts to determining the best pipeline designs with architectsâ€™ approval, I visualise where pipelines fit within the bigger picture of business and what sequential actions my fellow engineers should take to meet deadlines. I also like that there is room for creativity in this field, due to the numerous ways data can be collected, cleaned, modelled and predicted. I'm particularly interested in reducing bias such that any solutions I create benefit as many people as possible.</p>
									<p>I first entered the world of data in January 2023 via the Digital Futures training programme, from which I graduated with their highest ever intermediate Python exam result (98%). Within 8 months of my first engineering role where I was learning Scala for the first time, I was onboarding new hires on how to effectively use it. Both cases are indicative of my ability to grasp complex skills quickly.</p>
									<p>Before big data, I spent 5-6 years in more creative or communications-based roles such as marketing and event management, to which I also highly attribute my rapid growth. Those experiences laid the foundation for me to comfortably navigate stakeholder relationships such as resolving conflicts and escalating key dependencies, and to generate with new solutions from new perspectives in the face of setbacks.</p>
									<p>My current role sits within the ESG segment of financial services, and I want to continue applying myself within organisations committed to improving their ethical and sustainable practices with the help of tech and data.</p>
